    <h3>Description of the components</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Encoder</strong></li>
      <p>HT12E is a 2 12 series encoder IC (Integrated Circuit) for remote control applications. It is commonly used for radio frequency (RF) applications. By using the paired HT12E encoder and HT12D decoder we can easily transmit and receive 12 bits of parallel data serially. HT12E simply converts 12 bit parallel data into a serial output that can be transmitted through an RF transmitter 433MHz. ---> <a class="b1"href="https://www.farnell.com/datasheets/1899539.pdf">Datasheet</a></p>

      <li><strong>555 Timer</strong></li>
      <p>The 555 timer IC is an integrated circuit used in a variety of timer, pulse generation, and oscillator applications. The 555 can be used to provide time delays, as an oscillator, and as a flip-flop element. Derivatives provide two or four timing circuits in one package. There are two 555 timers, one for blinking the LED at low frequency, and the other for generating the audio frequency signal(1KHz) ---> <a class="b1"href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ne555.pdf">Datasheet</a></p>
      <li><strong>AT89S52/AT89C52</strong></li>
      <p>The AT89S52 is a low-power, high-performance CMOS 8-bit microcontroller with 8Kbytes of in-system programmable Flash memory. The device is manufactured using Atmel’s high-density nonvolatile memory technology and is compatible with the industry-standard 80C51 instruction set and pinout. The on-chip Flash allows the program memory to be reprogrammed in-system or by a conventional nonvolatile memory programmer. By combining a versatile 8-bit CPU with an in-system programmable Flash on a monolithic chip, the Atmel AT89S52 is a powerful microcontroller that provides a highly-flexible and cost-effective solution to many embedded control applications. The AT89S52 provides the following standard features: 8K bytes of Flash, 256 bytes of RAM, 32 I/O lines, Watchdog timer, two data pointers, three 16-bit timer/counters, a six-vector two-level interrupt architecture, a full-duplex serial port, on-chip oscillator, and clock circuitry. In addition, the AT89S52 is designed with static logic for operation down to zero frequency and supports two software selectable power saving modes. The Idle Mode stops the CPU while allowing the RAM, timer/counters, serial port, and interrupt system to continue functioning. The
The power-down mode saves the RAM contents but freezes the oscillator, disabling all other chip functions until the next interrupt or hardware reset. The AT89S52 detects the side of motion from RF Decoder. ---> <a class="b1"href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/devicedoc/doc1919.pdf">Datasheet</a></p>
      <li><strong>16*2 LCD Display</strong></li>
      <p>We come across LCD displays everywhere around us. Computers, calculators, television sets, mobile phones, digital watches use some kind of display to display the time. An LCD is an electronic display module which uses liquid crystal to produce a visible image. The 16×2 LCD display is a very basic module commonly used in DIYs and circuits. The 16×2 translates of a display 16 characters per line in 2 such lines.

    <h3>Working</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Transmitter</li>
      <p>
There are five circuits constructed in total. 4 of these circuits are for the 4 transmitters and the fifth circuit is for the receiver. Each circuit is built around an IC. The output of a PIR sensor is given to either of the data input AD8, AD9, AD10 or AD11 (pin 10,11,12 or 13) of the HT12E after inverting it with transistor T1, T2, T3 or T4. The Diodes D1 or D2 connects Transmission enable (TE complement) Pin with the Data Input pin so that both pins get input from the sensor at the same time.
LED is connected to the collector output of the transmitter so that it blinks when PS1 sensor output goes high. Address pins from A0 to A7 are grounded to set the address
00 (00000000b). Serial data output Dout (pin 17) is given as data input to the 434MHz RF Tx module. This circuit is powered with a 6V battery.
When the PIR of transmitter 1, PS1 detects motion, its output goes high. T1 conducts and LED1 Blinks. Pins AD8 and TE-complement of IC1 are pulled low together through the diodes D1 and D2. And the other pins are high. Due to this, the transmitter transfers data bits as 1110 for the transmitter 1. The table below gives different data transmitted.</p>
      <li>Reciever</li>
      <p>The Receiver is built using 434MHz RF Rx module, RF decoder chip HT12D, AT89S52 MCU and Multivibrators using 555 timers. Serial data output from 434 RX module is given to the input pin 14 of the HT12D decoder.
Address pins A0 through A7 of HT12 D are connected to the ground to set the same receiving address (0000 0000b) as the encoder. A LED is connected to a VT pin that blinks when the data is received. This output is inverted using a transistor and given to
external interrupt pin EX1 of AT89S52. Data output pins D8 to D11 are connected to pins P1.0 to P1.3, respectively.
The LCD data pins D0 to D7 are connected to port P0 of At89S52 and the pins RS and EN are connected to P2.0 ansd2.1. Preset VR1 is connected to pin3 to vary LCD brightness. Backlight LED pins15 and 16 are connected to +5 V via R23 and ground respectively to turn on LCD backlight.
There are 2 multivibrators circuits. Both are build using IC NE555 and configured in astable mode. Reset pin4 of both multivibrators is controlled by MCU port pins P2.2 and 2.3.
When the sensor detects motion, data is transmitted through RF Tx. This data is sent to a decoder which detects valid address indicated through the blinking of LED. The detector branches the data to different data pins. When the validity signal is high, MCU gets an interrupt signal. The bit pattern is received in the port P1 and based on the bit pattern it will decide which PIR is detected and display it on the LCD screen.
The multivibrator that flashes LED has a flashing rate of 2 Hz. The resistors and capacitors are chosen to give the desired flashing rate.
The other multivibrator generates 1KHZ, audio tone siren through the speaker (LS1). The resistors and capacitors are again chosen to give the desired result.
When a PIR sensor detects the signal, the output remains high for around 5 to10 seconds because of the slower response. The siren and LED continues flashing for about 10 seconds. The message for which PIR detects will be displayed in the LCD display. Then the siren and LED turn off.</p>
